# Go Baby Go - CBM

## Migration

Please note that due to free account limits on GitHub, we have opted to shift our development 
over to Bitbucket. Please head to [Go Baby Go - CBM](https://bitbucket.org/go-baby-go-cbm) for all 
development materials.


## About

This organizational grouping on GitHub serves as a means to aggregate the development and designs 
for the Go Baby Go project by the [Center for Bionic Medicine (CBM)](https://www.sralab.org/research/labs/bionic-medicine).

Please note that this project is not officially associated with the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab but is 
a volunteer effort by some of the staff in CBM. All development involves collaboration with:
   - [Illinois Spina Bifida Association](https://i-sba.org)
   - [Kiwanis Club River Forest-Oak Park](https://www.kiwanisclubrfop.org)

All projects and notes are released under the [Unilicense](LICENSE). We provide the 
materials included here as a reference to anyone working in the Go Baby Go space. We hope this 
serves as a stepping stone to improved designs and would love to hear back on any improvements 
made on what we have created here.


## Limitations of Legacy Projects

We shifted to using Git and this organization on GitHub spring of 2022. We have done our best to 
try to capture previous designs but please keep this in mind when looking back through older 
projects as some of the original designs and references have been lost to time. We still want to 
publish the materials we have but acknowledge there are some gaps in legacy materials provided.
